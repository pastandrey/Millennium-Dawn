tick_audit.py — Report how much recurring work Millennium Dawn does every
in-game day / week / month.

HOI4 only auto-fires six recurring on_action hooks per country:

    on_daily   on_weekly   on_monthly            (GLOBAL — run for every country,
    on_daily_<TAG>   on_weekly_<TAG>   on_monthly_<TAG>   staggered across the period)

Everything that "runs daily/weekly/monthly" ultimately hangs off one of those
hooks. This tool traces that graph and reports the cost, with one hard rule:

    ACCURACY CONTRACT — a scripted_effect, event, or decision is only reported
    as running on a cadence if it is genuinely REACHABLE from a real recurring
    hook of that cadence (directly, through a scripted_effect the hook calls,
    or as a self-rescheduling event loop). An event that merely EXISTS in
    events/ is never counted. `country_event = { id = X days = N }` is treated
    as a one-shot DELAY, not recurrence — it only becomes recurring if X
    reschedules itself (a loop), which is detected separately.

What it measures
    A (on_actions):  each recurring hook, the scripted_effects it invokes
                     (expanded transitively, as a work proxy), and the events it
                     fires DIRECTLY in its own body (country_event/news_event vs.
                     weighted random_events pools). Events fired only deep inside
                     shared scripted_effects are counted as work but NOT
                     attributed as fires — their firing is gated by in-effect
                     conditions (e.g. original_tag) that can't be evaluated
                     statically, so per-country attribution would over-report.
    B (timers):      timed decisions (real timer fields days_mission_timeout /
                     days_remove / days_re_enable, literal vs variable) bucketed
                     by period, and self-rescheduling event loops (immediate =
                     automatic tick, option = player-driven).

  limit/trigger checks), including everything it calls. It's a proxy for cost,
  not measured milliseconds. Click a row to open what it calls; click a file to
