"""Tests for the special-project completion check in validate_history.

A tech whose `allow` block contains `is_special_project_completed = sp:sp_X`
can only be researched after the matching special project is finished. A
country that starts with the tech but never completed the project has to
research the project before it can advance that branch, and its project-gated
equipment stays locked. The check walks each (tech, DLC-configuration) pair in
the history file and reports any tech whose required SP is not completed in the
same configuration, unless the SP is DLC-limited to a DLC absent in that
configuration (then the subsystem is off and the requirement is moot).
