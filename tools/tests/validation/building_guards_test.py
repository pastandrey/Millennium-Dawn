"""Tests for validate_building_guards.

A `damage_building` / `remove_building` effect naming a building type must sit
behind a guard trigger that proves that same building type is present --
otherwise the call spams error.log at scale (issue #2806). Guard detection
must track *which* building is proven present, not merely "is there an if?" --
an `if`/`limit` guarding something else entirely (an idea, a flag) must still
flag the effect inside it.
