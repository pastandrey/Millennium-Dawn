"""Regressions for the modify_treasury_effect state-scope check.

modify_treasury_effect writes the country-scope `treasury` variable, so calling
it inside a state block silently no-ops. The scope tracker only flags when the
nearest enclosing scope switch is a state, so random_list weights and intervening
owner/tag/ROOT openers must not produce false positives.
