description: Comprehensive guide to the economy system in Millennium Dawn
---

Millennium Dawn is set in the modern day and uses an in-depth economic system to model the importance of a nation's economy. You manage the entire state, not only its military and diplomacy. This includes taxation, government spending, debt, inflation, employment, and productivity. Each decision has interconnected consequences, and short-term fixes can create long-term problems. This guide explains the system so you can maintain a stable and growing economy.

## GDP and GDP per Capita

**GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** is calculated from active buildings and other factors. It represents the size of a country's economy and affects:

- Country rank national spirits (Superpower, Great Power, Minor Power, etc.)
- Number of research slots
- Interest rates (via the debt-to-GDP ratio)

**GDP per Capita** is GDP divided by total population, and indicates the wealth of a nation's population. A dynamic modifier applies scaling bonuses and penalties based on your GDP/C level:

| Effect                         | How It Scales                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Construction Speed             | Penalty increases with wealth, rich nations build slower                           |
| Population Growth              | Bonus for poor nations, penalty for wealthy nations (break-even around $60k GDP/C) |
| Research Speed                 | Bonus increases with wealth (kicks in above ~$51k GDP/C)                           |
| Stability                      | Small bonus that increases with wealth (kicks in above ~$100k GDP/C)               |
| Workforce Costs                | Wealthy nations require more workers per building                                  |
| Fossil Fuel Plant Construction | Cheaper for poor nations, expensive for rich ones                                  |

This means poor nations grow their population faster and build cheaply, but have lower research speed. Rich nations research faster and are more stable, but face higher costs for construction and workforce.

## Revenue

Your country's weekly income comes from multiple sources.

### Tax Income

The primary source of revenue is taxes, divided into two categories:

- **Corporate Tax**: Revenue from businesses and buildings
- **Population Tax**: Revenue from citizens

The **Average Tax Rate** shown in the economy UI is the average of your corporate and population tax rates.

### Corporate Tax

Corporate tax is calculated from multiple building types:

| Building Type         | Base Tax Factor |
| --------------------- | --------------- |
| Civilian Factories    | 2.5             |
| Offices               | 5.0             |
| Microchip Plants      | 4.0             |
| Composite Plants      | 3.5             |
| Synthetic Refineries  | 3.0             |
| Agriculture Districts | 2.6             |
| Military Factories    | 0.2             |
| Dockyards             | 0.2             |

**Corporate Tax side effects:**

- **Productivity Growth**: Higher taxes reduce productivity growth (20% tax = 0%, 40% tax = -10%)
- **Consumer Goods**: Each 1% corporate tax adds 0.015% to the consumer goods penalty
- **Investment Cost**: Higher taxes increase the cost of receiving foreign investments

### Population Tax

Population tax scales with:

- Total population
- GDP per capita (wealthier populations pay more)
- Your chosen tax rate

Higher population taxes apply a **stability penalty** (1% tax rate = -0.01% stability).

### Resource Exports

Countries earn income from exporting surplus resources on the international market. The following resources generate export revenue:

- Fossil Fuels, Steel, Light Metals, Technology Metals, Precious Metals, Rubber, Microchips, and Advanced Composites

Export income is affected by your trade law (which controls the minimum export percentage), mining policies, and currency strength. A weaker domestic currency makes resource exports more valuable in local terms, while a stronger currency reduces their local value.

### Dynamic Resource Pricing

Resource export prices are not fixed, they fluctuate globally based on worldwide supply and demand. Prices are recalculated periodically using the following formula:

```
Price = (Global Demand / Global Supply) × 2 × Starting Price
```

When global demand exceeds half of global supply (demand/supply ratio > 0.5), prices rise above the starting price. When demand falls below that ratio, prices drop. Each resource has a hard floor and ceiling that prices cannot exceed:

| Resource            | Starting Price | Price Floor | Price Ceiling |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Fossil Fuels        | 6.80           | 1.36        | 34.00         |
| Steel               | 0.024          | 0.005       | 0.120         |
| Light Metals        | 0.21           | 0.042       | 1.05          |
| Technology Metals   | 0.28           | 0.056       | 1.40          |
| Precious Metals     | 0.18           | 0.036       | 0.90          |
| Rubber              | 0.09           | 0.018       | 0.45          |
| Microchips          | 8.00           | 1.58        | 36.20         |
| Advanced Composites | 7.40           | 1.42        | 35.40         |

**Strategic implications:**

- Countries that control large shares of a scarce resource (e.g., Technology Metals, Precious Metals, Microchips) can indirectly benefit from high prices if global supply is tight.
- Building Microchip Plants and Composite Plants across many nations increases global supply of those resources, driving their prices down over the course of a game.
- Microchips and Advanced Composites have the highest price ceilings by far, a global shortage of either resource can make them extremely valuable exports.
- Fossil Fuel prices are the most volatile in practice, as fuel demand is high and supply is concentrated in relatively few states.

### Seigniorage Income

Reserve currency issuers (the countries controlling USD, EUR, CNY, RUB, JPY, GBP, CHF, and NLG) earn passive seigniorage income proportional to how many other nations have adopted their currency. The more countries that hold your currency as their reserve, the more seigniorage you earn. Only issuers can use **Expand Money Supply** to increase that income at the cost of weakening their currency.

### Additional Income

Various sources provide supplementary revenue:

- **Foreign Aid**: Some countries receive aid (e.g., US aid to allies, Iranian aid to partners)
- **International Investments**: Returns from investing in other countries (~6% annually)
- **Trade Routes**: Controlling strategic chokepoints (Suez, Panama, Hormuz) provides income
- **EU Subsidies**: Member states receive various subsidies
- **Country-Specific Income**: Special ideas and national foci (tourism, narcotics, etc.)

## Expenses

Government spending is divided into six categories. Higher spending levels provide buffs but cost more.

### Military Spending

Military spending is the most complex expense category:

| Cost Component         | Description                                           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Military Industry | Military factories and dockyards                      |
| Personnel Costs        | Soldiers (special forces > elite > regular > militia) |
| Equipment Costs        | Weapons, vehicles, aircraft, naval vessels            |
| Deployed vs Stockpiled | Equipment in use costs more than in storage           |

**Military Spending Levels (0–9):**

- Level 0: Minimal funding (~0.46× multiplier)
- Level 9: Maximum funding (~10× multiplier)

GDP per capita affects military costs, wealthier nations pay more to maintain their armed forces.

### Bureaucracy

Bureaucracy spending affects policy implementation speed, national focus completion time, and administrative efficiency.

**Levels 1–5:** Costs scale from 1× to 3.4× base rate, based on population.

### Police/Security

Police spending provides stability bonuses and counter-terrorism effectiveness.

**Levels 1–5:** Costs scale from 1× to 3.4× base rate, based on population.

### Education

Education spending is influenced by population size, number of research slots, and nuclear, air, land, and naval facilities.

**Levels 1–5:** Provides research speed and population growth bonuses.

### Health

Health spending scales with population and provides population growth, stability, and manpower recovery bonuses. The cost and effectiveness of health spending is modified by your **Healthcare Privatization** law.

**Levels 1–6:** Costs scale from 1.1× to 11× base rate.

### Social/Welfare

Social spending affects stability and the impact of unemployment.

**Levels 1–6:** Costs scale from 1× to 9.5× base rate. High social spending reduces the penalties from unemployment.

---

## Debt and Interest

### Interest Rate Calculation

When you have debt, your annual interest rate is determined by:

```
Interest Rate = (Debt / GDP) × 10 + (Central Bank Policy Rate × 0.33) + modifiers
```

The modifiers include national spirits, current world tension, and the world tension your country has generated. Current world tension adds up to 5 percentage points. The premium for tension you generated decays by 3.5% each week.

- **Minimum interest rate with debt**: 0.8%
- **Maximum interest rate with debt**: 50%
- **Without debt**: The interest rate and weekly interest payment are both zero

Each 1 percentage point increase in the policy rate adds 0.33 percentage points to debt interest before the minimum and maximum apply. A 6% policy rate therefore contributes 1.98 points. Raising the policy rate to fight inflation also increases debt costs, but by about a third of the rate change, not half.

Hover over **Total Debt** to see the contributions from debt-to-GDP, national spirits, the policy rate, and both tension premiums. The tooltip also shows any adjustment from the minimum or maximum rate. Check **Interest on Debt** for the weekly payment, which also depends on your reserve currency and currency strength.

If your weekly balance is negative, or if a national focus or event causes you to spend more than your current funds, debt is automatically issued. The game borrows 1% of GDP plus the deficit, with a 1% fee applied to automatically borrowed funds.

Debt under a reserve currency law is exposed to currency strength: a weak currency raises weekly interest payments, while a strong currency lowers them. **No Foreign Reserve** removes this exchange-rate adjustment, not the underlying interest rate. See [Reserve Currency](#reserve-currency) for the payment multiplier.

### High Interest Penalties

When interest exceeds **15%**, severe penalties activate:

| Penalty                 | Effect                                           |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Construction Speed      | -5% per point above 15%                          |
| Factory/Dockyard Output | -5% per point above 15%                          |
| Stability               | -2% per point above 15%                          |
| Political Drift         | -1% per point above 15% (affects all ideologies) |

If debt continues to spiral, the consequences become severe: debtor nations can gain war justifications against you for defaulting, opposition parties may demand elections, and in extreme cases civil war can occur.

### Managing Debt

1. Maintain a positive weekly balance to pay down debt naturally
2. Reduce military spending temporarily
3. Increase tax rates cautiously (reduces productivity)
4. Use economic foci to reduce interest rates
5. Build up treasury reserves during economic upturns
6. Request bailouts before interest rates spiral above 15% (see [IMF and Bailouts](#imf-and-bailouts))
7. Strengthen your currency to reduce foreign-denominated debt burden

---

## Tax Rate Changes

Tax rates are adjusted through the economy interface:

- **Change Limit**: Taxes can only be changed once every 5 months (250 days)
- **Corporate Tax**: Affects building output, productivity, consumer goods
- **Population Tax**: Affects stability

**Tax Rate Change Cost**: Each 1% change costs approximately 50 political power.

For many countries, **20-30% corporate tax** is a practical starting range. A 20% rate avoids the productivity growth penalty; rates above that trade some long-term growth for additional revenue. Adjust the rate to your budget and development strategy rather than treating this range as a universal target.

---

## Currency and Monetary Policy

Millennium Dawn models a currency system where each country has a **currency strength** variable that affects income, debt costs, and inflation.

### Reserve Currency

Choose your reserve currency through the **Reserve Currency** law in the Politics window. This choice affects investment returns, trade bonuses, and whether debt interest payments receive an exchange-rate adjustment. The available options include:

| Currency             | Typical Adopters                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| US Dollar (USD)      | Default for most nations                   |
| Euro (EUR)           | EU member states                           |
| Chinese Yuan (CNY)   | Chinese faction members and aligned states |
| Japanese Yen (JPY)   | Japanese faction members                   |
| Russian Rouble (RUB) | Russian faction members                    |
| British Pound (GBP)  | UK faction members                         |
| Swiss Franc (CHF)    | Switzerland and Liechtenstein only         |
| No Foreign Reserve   | Isolated or autarkic states                |

With a reserve currency, weekly debt interest is multiplied by **1 / currency strength**, capped at **2×**. A strength of 0.5 doubles the payment; a strength of 2.0 halves it. This changes the payment, not the displayed annual interest rate.

Choosing **No Foreign Reserve** keeps that multiplier at **1×** and grants a small political power bonus, but removes the reserve currency ROI and trade bonuses that come from being part of a major currency network. Switching to a reserve currency restores the exchange-rate adjustment; switching back to No Foreign Reserve removes it.

### Currency Strength

Currency strength is recalculated monthly. Falls are a share of its current level, so a weak currency falls in smaller steps. Each currency is pulled back toward its **base strength**, while your economy pushes it up or down:

| Factor             | Effect                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Real interest rate | A policy rate more than 1 point above inflation supports your currency. A lower rate weakens it.                                                                |
| Debt interest rate | The part of your debt's interest rate not set by the policy rate weakens your currency once it passes 5 points, and quickly past 10. Having no debt is neutral. |
| Inflation          | Weakens your currency through the real interest rate. A policy rate that keeps pace with inflation shields it.                                                  |
| Stability          | Stability above 50% strengthens your currency, and stability below 50% weakens it.                                                                              |
| Economic cycle     | A boom or fast growth helps. Stagnation, recession and depression hurt.                                                                                         |
| War                | Losing a war or fighting a civil war weakens your currency.                                                                                                     |
| Sanctions          | International sanctions weaken your currency.                                                                                                                   |
| Financial collapse | Your currency is weaker for three years after a financial collapse.                                                                                             |
| Reserve issuers    | Each country using your currency as its reserve strengthens it slightly.                                                                                        |
| Safe havens        | While world tension stays above 50%, the US dollar and Japanese yen strengthen slightly, and the Swiss franc a little more.                                     |
| National spirits   | A spirit with a **Currency Strength Target** value moves the level your currency is pulled toward by that amount. The pull closes 1% of the gap a month.        |

At a policy rate of 0%, the real interest rate can pull your currency down by at most 1% a month. Each point of the rate takes 2.5% off that limit, so a rate of 20% halves it. A higher rate therefore helps even when inflation is far above it.

Your base strength starts at your country's historical value and slowly follows your currency. It rises at half the speed it falls, so trust is lost faster than it is earned. Years of good management raise the level your currency settles at, and years of bad management lower it.

Currency strength ranges from 0.15 (extremely weak) to 2.0 (extremely strong), with 1.0 as neutral. A national spirit with a **Minimum Currency Strength** value raises that floor to the value shown, and values from several spirits add up. Its effects include:

- **Weak currency** (below 1.0): Resource exports and international investment returns are worth more in local terms, but foreign-denominated debt costs more and inflation pressure increases
- **Strong currency** (above 1.0): Foreign-denominated debt is cheaper and inflation is suppressed, but export income and investment returns decrease in local terms

Reserve currency issuers (USD, EUR, etc.) have dampened volatility -- their currencies cannot swing as dramatically as smaller nations.

### Currency Backing

The **Currency Backing** law determines how your currency is anchored:

| Backing           | Stability | Trade Opinion | Other Effects                            |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Gold Standard     | +6%       | +4%           | -5% political power; low volatility      |
| Silver Standard   | +3%       | +2%           | -2% political power; moderate volatility |
| Bi-Metal Standard | +2%       | +1%           | Moderate volatility                      |
| Fiat Currency     | -2%       | --            | +0.03 daily PP; highest flexibility      |

Hard-money standards dampen currency volatility and lift a currency at or below par (1.0) every month: gold and silver by 0.003, and a bi-metal standard by 0.002. The monthly fall is a share of the current level, so that lift stops the monthly slide at about 0.60 on gold, 0.38 on silver, and 0.20 on a bi-metal standard. However, they restrict monetary policy flexibility -- you cannot use the Expand Money Supply decision while on the gold standard.

### Monetary Policy Decisions

Two monetary policy decisions are available (AI-controlled nations use these automatically):

- **Expand Money Supply**: Increases seigniorage income by 25% and weakens currency strength by 0.05. Cannot be used alongside Austerity Measures or while on the gold standard. Lasts 180 days with a 365-day cooldown.
- **Austerity Measures**: Strengthens currency by 0.04. Lasts 120 days with a 180-day cooldown. Cannot be used alongside Expand Money Supply.

The AI expands the money supply only when its treasury is negative, its currency is above its base strength and inflation is under 5%. It uses austerity measures when inflation is above 5% and its currency is below its base strength.

## Inflation

Inflation is one of the most important economic variables in Millennium Dawn. It is recalculated every quarter (months 3, 6, 9, and 12) and applies broad modifiers to nearly every part of your economy. Unlike a simple currency effect, inflation is driven by the interaction of GDP per capita growth, tax policy, the central bank policy rate, the economic cycle, budget balance, and currency strength.

### What Drives Inflation

Six factors feed into the quarterly inflation calculation:

| Factor                       | Effect on Inflation                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GDP/C Growth**             | Higher GDP per capita growth directly increases inflation pressure. A rapidly growing economy generates demand that pushes prices up.                   |
| **Tax Rate**                 | Higher average tax rates reduce inflation pressure. Taxes act as a fiscal brake on the economy -- they pull money out of circulation.                   |
| **Central Bank Policy Rate** | Positive rate points reduce inflation carryover; rates at or below 0% leave it at 90%. A rate below neutral also adds more inflation.                   |
| **Economic Cycle**           | Boom and fast growth stages add inflationary pressure. Depression and recession stages reduce it. Stable growth is neutral.                             |
| **Budget Balance**           | A budget deficit increases inflation (simulating money printing to cover the gap). A budget surplus decreases it.                                       |
| **Currency Strength**        | A weak currency (below 1.0) feeds additional inflation pressure through higher import costs. A strong currency suppresses it.                           |

### The Inflation Formula

Each quarter, the game calculates an inflation adjustment from the factors above, then averages the last four quarters to produce the annual inflation rate. This averaging smooths out short-term spikes.

**Step-by-step:**

1. **GDP/C growth contribution**: The base adjustment starts from last quarter's GDP per capita growth rate, scaled by your GDP per capita level. Higher GDP/C amplifies the effect of growth on prices.
2. **Tax dampening**: The adjustment is reduced proportionally to your average tax rate. At higher tax rates, more of the growth-driven inflation is absorbed.
3. **Policy rate effect**: The policy rate is compared with a neutral rate and also cuts how much inflation carries into the next quarter. See [Central Bank Policy Rate](#central-bank-policy-rate).
4. **Economic cycle**: The current cycle stage applies an additional adjustment, scaled by total government spending:

| Cycle Stage   | Inflation Adjustment |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Depression    | -0.035               |
| Recession     | -0.025               |
| Stagnation    | -0.015               |
| Stable Growth | 0                    |
| Fast Growth   | +0.015               |
| Economic Boom | +0.025               |

5. **Budget balance**: A deficit adds inflationary pressure proportional to the shortfall. A surplus has the opposite effect.
6. **Money printing multiplier**: If the Expand Money Supply decision is active, the entire adjustment is amplified.

A national spirit with an **Inflation Gain** value scales a positive quarterly result by that percentage. At -20%, a quarterly result of 5% becomes 4%. It does not change a quarter of deflation.

The quarterly result is stored and averaged with the previous three quarters. The rate is clamped to prevent wild swings: no more than +/-10 percentage points change per quarter, and a hard cap of +/-200% total.

### Central Bank Policy Rate

The **Central Bank Policy Rate** represents your country's monetary policy stance. The manual controls range from **-10% to 30%**. Most countries start at 3%; Ukraine starts at 30% in January 2000.

To change it:

1. Open the Economic Preview and find **Policy Rate**.
2. Keep more than 25 political power available. Each click spends 25 political power and raises or lowers the rate by **1 percentage point**.
3. Wait **30 days** before another manual change. Increase is unavailable at 30%, and decrease is unavailable at -10%.

Ukraine's National Bank rate-cut events can also lower the rate. Accepted cuts cannot take it below 0% and block another rate change for **60 days**. A later event can therefore lower a rate you raised manually; player-controlled countries do not receive the generic AI adjustment.

The rate works on inflation in two ways:

- **Against the neutral rate.** The neutral rate uses inflation or a low-inflation baseline, whichever is higher, plus 0.5 to 2.5 points. It is limited to 1-30%. Each point your rate sits above neutral removes 0.2% of inflation a quarter. Each point below adds 0.2%, so negative rates provide additional inflation stimulus during deflation. The effect stops at 3% either way.
- **As a share of inflation.** Inflation above about 2% carries into the next quarter. At a rate of 0%, 90% of it carries over. Each positive point of the rate takes 2.5 points off that share, down to 25% once the rate reaches 26%. Negative rates do not raise this share above 90%; their additional stimulus comes from the gap below neutral. This works at any inflation level, so a high rate still pulls down inflation that is far above 30%. A budget deficit above the sustainable 2-8% of GDP shrinks each point's cut. At 10% of GDP over that level the cut is halved, and it goes no lower, so a deficit never cancels the rate.

AI-controlled countries move their rate toward a target once a quarter, provided no rate-change cooldown is active. During deflation, that target uses the actual negative inflation rate plus the natural real rate and can fall to -10%. Otherwise it matches the neutral rate. The AI moves three points when it is more than 5 points from the target, and one point when it is more than half a point away. It never cuts below -10% or raises above 20%, so only a player can take it to 30%. Each AI change starts a 60-day cooldown.

Manual changes update debt costs immediately. Inflation responds at the next quarterly calculation and is averaged over four quarters, so do not expect a rate increase to remove inflation at once.

The gap between your rate and inflation also moves your currency. See [Currency Strength](#currency-strength).

### Currency and Inflation

Currency strength has a separate, additive effect on inflation costs. The gap between 1.0 and your currency strength feeds into a **currency inflation component**:

```
Currency Inflation = (1.0 / Currency Strength - 1.0) × 0.025
```

This is added to the base inflation rate to produce the **combined inflation cost** that the dynamic modifier uses. A currency at 0.5 strength adds 2.5% additional inflation pressure. A currency at 1.0 adds nothing. Above 1.0 the component goes negative, so a strong currency eases inflation costs. At 2.0 it subtracts 1.25%.

This means inflation has two independent sources: the quarterly macroeconomic calculation and the currency channel. You can have low base inflation but still suffer high effective inflation if your currency has collapsed.

### Effects of Inflation

Inflation applies a dynamic modifier that scales with the inflation rate. The effects are proportional -- higher inflation means stronger penalties:

| Effect                       | Multiplier                          | Example at 10% Inflation |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Overall cost multiplier      | 1.0× inflation rate                 | +10% costs               |
| Project costs                | 1.0× inflation rate                 | +10% project costs       |
| Economic cycle upgrade costs | 1.25× inflation rate                | +12.5% cycle costs       |
| Corruption costs             | Scaled by inflation                 | Increased                |
| Productivity growth          | 1.3× inflation rate (penalty)       | -13% productivity growth |
| Construction speed           | 2.0× inflation rate (bonus to cost) | +20% construction costs  |
| Factory/dockyard output      | -1.25× inflation rate               | -12.5% output            |
| Political power              | -1.3× inflation rate                | -13% PP generation       |
| Consumer goods               | -0.5× inflation rate                | +5% consumer goods need  |
| Trade law change costs       | 1.5× inflation rate                 | +15% trade law costs     |

**Deflation** (negative inflation) reverses most of these: costs decrease but output penalties still apply in the opposite direction. Mild deflation can be beneficial, but severe deflation signals economic contraction.

### Managing Inflation

Inflation responds to multiple levers. Here are the main strategies:

**Raise the central bank policy rate.** The most direct tool. Every point cuts how much inflation carries into the next quarter, even when inflation is far above the rate. A large budget deficit can halve that cut, so fix the budget alongside it. The tradeoff is that high rates also raise debt interest and slow economic growth.

**Raise taxes.** Higher tax rates dampen inflation by pulling money out of the economy. However, high corporate taxes reduce productivity growth, so this is a short-term fix with long-term costs.

**Run a budget surplus.** Spending less than you earn reduces inflationary pressure. Cut military spending or unnecessary government programs to bring the budget into surplus.

**Strengthen the currency.** Use Austerity Measures, reduce debt, or improve stability to push currency strength above 1.0. This eliminates the currency inflation channel.

**Adopt a hard-money standard.** Gold, silver, and bi-metal backing dampen currency volatility and pull it toward 1.0 over time, which indirectly reduces currency-driven inflation. However, hard-money standards restrict your ability to use the Expand Money Supply decision.

**Avoid the Expand Money Supply decision during high inflation.** This decision amplifies the inflation adjustment and weakens the currency -- useful during deflation but dangerous during inflation.

**Upgrade the economic cycle cautiously.** While a booming economy is desirable, the Fast Growth and Economic Boom stages add inflationary pressure. If inflation is already high, pushing for a higher cycle stage can make it worse.

## Economic Indicators

### Employment

Buildings require workers to function at full efficiency. Each facility has a required worker count, and you must allocate a portion of the national population to fill those positions. Allocation is automatic, but buildings without enough workers have reduced output.

If all buildings are fully staffed and workers remain, those workers become unemployed. The unemployment rate is shown in the Economy window.

If unemployment exceeds the **Unemployment Threshold** shown in the Economy window, debuffs apply: a stability penalty and increased social spending. These debuffs grow stronger as unemployment rises.

You can prioritize which building types receive workers first from the Economy window.

### Productivity

**State Productivity** is a per-state variable that directly scales building output and GDP. Each state has its own productivity value, and the country-level overall productivity is calculated as the population-weighted average across controlled states.

The economic baseline is **1,000 or the world average productivity, whichever is higher**. GDP and corporate tax income scale with overall productivity divided by this baseline. Productivity also contributes bonuses or penalties to industrial output and construction speed. Once the world average exceeds 1,000, your productivity must keep pace to maintain the same benefits.

This creates two broad development paths:

- **Lower-productivity countries** benefit from affordable agriculture and basic industry while using network infrastructure and internal investment to improve productivity.
- **Higher-productivity countries** gain more value from offices and advanced industry, but must support them with sufficient workers, electricity, and microchips.

**What Productivity Affects:**

- **Military factory output**: Higher productivity increases factory output
- **Dockyard output**: Naval construction speed and output
- **Construction speed**: All building construction is faster in high-productivity states
- **Agriculture district output**: Farming yields scale with productivity
- **GDP**: Scales with overall productivity relative to the economic baseline

**Starting Values by Region:**

| Region                                     | Starting Productivity |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Europe                                     | 1,000                 |
| Asia & Oceania                             | 650                   |
| Africa, Middle East, North & South America | 550                   |

Productivity is clamped between 100 and 100,000.

**Catch-Up Mechanic:**

Productivity changes monthly. When national growth is positive, states below the world average receive a catch-up bonus, while states above it grow more slowly, before local modifiers apply. With negative national growth, more productive states suffer larger declines relative to the world average; local growth modifiers do not apply.

**Reading the Productivity Tooltip:**

Hover over the productivity value in the Economy window to see the current world and national averages, followed by the monthly growth breakdown:

- **Base Productivity Growth**: The existing combined modifier from laws, ideas and technologies, including the economic cycle. Corporate tax and literacy values are shown as included contributions, not additional bonuses. These values are before the monthly ×0.5 factor and national modifiers.
- **National Growth Modifier**: The existing combined modifier from laws, ideas and technologies. Inflation is shown as an included contribution. Its multiplier is 1 plus the combined modifier, limited to 0–100. For example, a total modifier of −21.7% gives a multiplier of ×0.783.
- **Monthly Growth Before State Adjustments**: Base productivity growth ×0.5 × the national multiplier. Base growth of 0.100 with ×0.783 gives about 0.039 monthly growth. Each state then applies its world-average adjustment and, for positive growth, its local modifiers. The displayed number is therefore not the final change in every state or in the national average.
- **Effect of Productivity**: The current GDP, output, construction and corporate tax modifiers. Commercialized Agriculture Districts have a separate construction-speed modifier.

**Factors That Increase Productivity Growth:**

| Factor                         | Growth Bonus                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Railway infrastructure level 1 | +4%                                                  |
| Railway infrastructure level 2 | +8%                                                  |
| Railway infrastructure level 3 | +12%                                                 |
| Railway infrastructure level 4 | +16%                                                 |
| Railway infrastructure level 5 | +20%                                                 |
| Railway infrastructure level 6 | +24%                                                 |
| Internal investment (state)    | +20% growth in that state while investment is active |
| Economic Cycle (Fast Growth)   | +1.0 monthly base productivity growth                |
| Economic Cycle (Economic Boom) | +1.75 monthly base productivity growth               |
| National focuses and spirits   | Varies                                               |

**Corporate Tax and Productivity:**

Higher corporate taxes reduce the base monthly growth contribution. The relationship is linear, before national and state modifiers:

- At 20% corporate tax: no contribution to base growth
- At 40% corporate tax: −0.050 productivity points per month

This is an additive reduction in productivity points, not a percentage reduction in total growth.

High taxes generate revenue but slow long-term growth. Finding a balance between revenue needs and long-term productivity is one of the core tensions in economic management.

## Economic Cycle

The Economic Cycle represents the overall state of a country's economy. It is displayed as the second icon from the left in the National Statistics and Internal Factions section of the Politics window.

There are six stages, each with distinct modifiers:

| Stage         | Construction Speed | Stability | Productivity Growth | Migration Rate |
| ------------- | ------------------ | --------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Depression    | --                 | -10%      | -4.0                | -0.25          |
| Recession     | +20%               | -5%       | -2.5                | -0.15          |
| Stagnation    | +30%               | -2%       | -1.0                | -0.05          |
| Stable Growth | +35%               | --        | +0.5                | +0.05          |
| Fast Growth   | +45%               | +2%       | +2.0                | +0.15          |
| Economic Boom | +55%               | +4%       | +3.5                | +0.25          |

**Upgrading the Economic Cycle** costs both political power and treasury funds. The political power cost increases with each upgrade, and a treasury payment is deducted when the new stage is adopted. Depression is the worst state, reducing productivity growth severely and preventing immigration.

**Changing the Economic Cycle:**

- Spend political power and treasury funds to manually upgrade it
- Some national focuses advance the Economic Cycle directly
- Random events tied to high GDP growth rates can raise it
- Negative events -- such as a housing bubble burst, stock market crash, or banking crisis -- can lower it by one or two levels

## Trade Laws

Trade laws control how much of your resource production is exported versus consumed domestically. They are changed through the Politics window and cost 150 political power per change. You can only move one tier at a time (no skipping levels), and certain restrictions apply -- Rentier States (oil-dependent economies) cannot adopt Closed Economy or Consumption Economy, and reducing trade openness may be blocked by international obligations or sanctions.

| Tier | Law                     | Min Export | Consumer Goods | Resource Export Multiplier | Trade Opinion |
| ---- | ----------------------- | ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1    | Closed Economy          | 10%        | +8%            | --                         | -30%          |
| 2    | Consumption Economy     | 20%        | +6%            | +4%                        | -20%          |
| 3    | Semi-Consumption        | 40%        | +3%            | +8%                        | -10%          |
| 4    | Mixed Economy (default) | 50%        | --             | +12%                       | +10%          |
| 5    | Export Economy          | 65%        | -3%            | +16%                       | +20%          |
| 6    | Globalized Trade        | 80%        | -6%            | +20%                       | +30%          |

**Key tradeoffs:**

- **Closed/Consumption**: Keeps resources at home for domestic industry. Useful when at war or when you consume more than you produce. Reduces export income and trade opinion. Closed Economy requires either an autocratic government or being at war with a stronger enemy while short on resources.
- **Mixed**: The default starting position. Balanced exports and domestic supply.
- **Export/Globalized**: Maximizes resource export income and trade opinion but forces most production onto the international market, leaving less for domestic use. Reduces consumer goods costs, reflecting the income benefits of open trade.

Inflation increases the cost of changing trade laws (via the `trade_laws_cost_factor` modifier), so adjusting trade policy during high inflation is more expensive.

## Economic Laws

Several law categories in the Politics window allow you to fine-tune your economic policies. Each law has multiple tiers that can be changed by spending political power.

### Employment Pressure

Controls how many workers each building requires. Adjusting this law helps manage unemployment:

| Level                     | Worker Requirement | Unemployment Threshold |
| ------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Comprehensive Regulations | +25%               | -5%                    |
| Strong Regulations        | +12%               | -2%                    |
| Standard Regulations      | Baseline           | Baseline               |
| Light Regulations         | -12%               | +2%                    |
| Minimal Regulations       | -25%               | +5%                    |

Higher regulations force buildings to hire more workers (reducing unemployment) but increase costs. Lower regulations reduce staffing needs, which can help during labor shortages but raises the threshold before unemployment penalties kick in.

### Healthcare Privatization

Determines whether healthcare is publicly or privately run, affecting both health spending costs and health-related income:

| Level                  | Health Cost | Healthcare Income | Workforce Requirement |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Fully Privatized       | -35%        | -40%              | -15%                  |
| Partially Privatized   | -15%        | -20%              | -8%                   |
| Partially Nationalized | +15%        | +15%              | +8%                   |
| Fully Nationalized     | +35%        | +30%              | +15%                  |

Privatized healthcare is cheaper for the government but generates less income and employs fewer workers. Nationalized healthcare costs more but provides greater health coverage and employs more people.

### Mining Policies

Controls resource extraction rates and environmental impact:

| Level                          | Resource Output | Export Multiplier | Stability |
| ------------------------------ | --------------- | ----------------- | --------- |
| Full Environmental Protections | -20%            | -15%              | +15%      |
| Partial Protections            | -10%            | -5%               | +10%      |
| Balanced Protections           | +5%             | --                | +5%       |
| Economic Motivated Mining      | +15%            | +5%               | --        |
| Strip Mining                   | +25%            | +15%              | --        |

Resource-rich nations benefit from looser mining policies but sacrifice stability. Nations with few natural resources lose little from strict protections.

### Critical Infrastructure

Determines the level of infrastructure maintenance spending:

| Level                 | Infrastructure Cost | Infrastructure Tax Income | Energy Output |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------- |
| Minimal Maintenance   | -25%                | -15%                      | -15%          |
| Standard Maintenance  | -5%                 | --                        | -1.5%         |
| Extensive Maintenance | +25%                | +35%                      | +15%          |

Wealthy nations benefit from extensive maintenance, which boosts both infrastructure tax income and energy generation. Poorer nations may prefer minimal maintenance to conserve funds.

## Literacy

Literacy represents the education level of your population and applies a dynamic modifier that scales with your country's literacy rate. It is primarily improved through education spending and national focuses.

| Effect                    | How It Scales                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Research Speed            | Higher literacy increases research speed                                                           |
| Productivity Growth       | Higher literacy improves long-term productivity                                                    |
| Education Costs           | Higher literacy increases the cost of maintaining education systems                                |
| Office Productivity       | Educated populations are more productive in office buildings                                       |
| Agricultural Productivity | Higher literacy _reduces_ agricultural output (workers shift away from farming into other sectors) |

The literacy-agriculture tradeoff is most relevant for agrarian economies. Investing heavily in education shifts workers out of the fields, reducing agricultural output even as it boosts research and office productivity. Countries that still rely on farming income need to balance literacy growth against agricultural needs.

---

## Internal Factions

Internal factions represent competing economic and political interest groups within your country. Each faction applies a dynamic modifier that scales with the faction's influence level. Factions can be empowered or weakened through decisions, events, and national focuses.

The main factions with economic effects include:

| Faction                            | Key Economic Effects                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Small & Medium Business Owners** | Construction speed, stability, consumer goods, civilian factory tax income and productivity |
| **International Bankers**          | Office construction, resource output, trade opinion, investment cost and duration           |
| **Fossil Fuel Industry**           | Resource output, fuel production, oil export income                                         |
| **Industrial Conglomerates**       | Infrastructure construction, resource output, civilian industry tax income                  |
| **Oligarchs**                      | Factory construction, resource output                                                       |
| **Defense Industry**               | Military factory construction speed, military factory productivity and tax income           |
| **Maritime Industry**              | Dockyard construction, dockyard output and productivity, dockyard tax income                |
| **Labour Unions**                  | Factory efficiency, political power, health and social spending costs                       |
| **Landowners**                     | Resource output, factory construction, office tax income                                    |
| **Farmers**                        | Consumer goods, population growth, agricultural productivity and construction               |
| **Communist Cadres**               | Consumer goods, bureaucracy costs                                                           |
| **The Priesthood**                 | Stability, political power, education costs                                                 |

Each faction's effects can be positive or negative depending on their influence level and your government's relationship with them. Strong factions aligned with your policies provide bonuses; powerful factions that oppose your government can impose penalties. Managing faction influence is part of the political game but has direct economic consequences.

## Sanctions

International sanctions are applied to countries through events, UN votes, and diplomatic actions. Sanctions come in four tiers of increasing severity:

| Tier                            | Construction | Stability | PP        | Trade Opinion | Other Effects                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | --------- | --------- | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Reduced Western Sanctions       | -20%         | -1%       | -0.05/day | -10%          | -20% resource exports             |
| Western Sanctions               | -40%         | -2%       | -0.1/day  | -50%          | -50% resource exports             |
| International Sanctions         | -10%         | -10%      | -10%      | -50%          | Blocked from international market |
| Massive International Sanctions | -60%         | -10%      | -0.25/day | -75%          | -75% resource exports             |

At the **International Sanctions** level and above, countries are locked out of resource exports entirely and lose access to international trade benefits.

Sanctions can be increased or decreased through diplomatic events. Reducing sanctions typically requires diplomatic alignment changes, completing certain focuses, or negotiation through international bodies.

## Electricity

Countries must supply electricity as part of their infrastructure. Power is generated by constructing specific buildings:

| Building                        | Fuel Source            | Output (base) |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- |
| Fossil Fuel Powerplant          | Fuel                   | 2 GW          |
| Nuclear Reactor                 | Reactor-Grade Material | 5 GW          |
| Renewable Energy Infrastructure | None                   | 0.5 GW        |

The renewable figure is a base value, not guaranteed output. Each state receives its own renewable capacity factor, and actual generation is randomized monthly between zero and that state's potential. Regions with better capacity factors produce more on average, but renewable-heavy grids still need room for monthly fluctuations.

Reactor-Grade Material can be produced at Enrichment Facilities (built from the electricity panel) or purchased from other countries via decisions. States with Geothermal Infrastructure or Hydroelectric Infrastructure modifiers provide additional power.

Electricity consumption is calculated from active buildings and population. Each building type consumes energy per level:

| Building              | Energy Consumption (GW per level) |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Composite Plants      | 0.80                              |
| Microchip Plants      | 0.75                              |
| Civilian Factories    | 0.50                              |
| Military Factories    | 0.50                              |
| Dockyards             | 0.50                              |
| Offices               | 0.25                              |
| Synthetic Refineries  | 0.20                              |
| Agriculture Districts | 0.10                              |

Population energy consumption also scales with total population and GDP per capita, wealthier, larger nations consume significantly more electricity.

Insufficient power generation triggers a dynamic modifier that scales with the size of the shortfall:

| Penalty                 | Effect                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Construction Speed      | Reduced proportionally to energy deficit                |
| Factory/Dockyard Output | Reduced proportionally to energy deficit                |
| Research Speed          | Reduced proportionally to energy deficit                |
| Tax Income              | Reduced (businesses produce less revenue without power) |
| Stability               | Penalty from energy shortages                           |

Countries that share power via **Energy Load Sharing** agreements can offset some of their deficit by importing electricity from neighbors, but at a cost.

Additionally, fossil fuel powerplants consume fuel to operate. If your country runs out of fuel, a separate **fuel shortage penalty** applies:

- Reduced tax income
- Stability penalty

This is independent of the electricity shortfall penalty, you can have enough generating capacity but still suffer if you lack the fuel to run your plants.

View your country's electricity situation by clicking the electricity icon in the construction window to open the Electricity Panel. Energy output can be further improved through the **Critical Infrastructure** law.

## Buildings

Millennium Dawn replaces or supplements many standard HOI4 buildings with modern equivalents. Beyond the standard civilian and military factories, the following buildings play key roles in the economy.

### Offices

Offices are the backbone of a modern service economy. They employ the most workers per level of any building (0.473 million per level) and generate the highest corporate tax income factor (5.0), making them the single best building for tax revenue. Building offices is the primary way to grow GDP and reduce unemployment in developed nations.

| Property               | Value                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Base Construction Cost | 40,000                  |
| Max Per State          | 50                      |
| Shares Building Slots  | Yes                     |
| Corporate Tax Factor   | 5.0                     |
| Energy Consumption     | 0.25 GW per level       |
| Base Workers           | 0.473 million per level |

Offices also drive civilian microchip consumption, each staffed office consumes microchips proportional to its worker fulfillment, so nations with many offices need corresponding microchip production.

### Internet Stations

Internet stations represent a country's digital infrastructure. Each level provides a **+5% state productivity growth modifier**, making them a long-term multiplier on economic output. They are cheap to build and employ few workers, making them an efficient early investment.

| Property               | Value                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Base Construction Cost | 5,000 (+1,450 per additional level)     |
| Max Per State          | 6                                       |
| Shares Building Slots  | No                                      |
| Base Workers           | 0.012 million per level                 |
| Effect                 | +5% state productivity growth per level |

### Agriculture Districts

Agriculture districts represent organized commercial farming. They produce **fuel** (8 units per hour per level, representing ethanol/biofuel) and provide **local supply** (+0.015 per level) to the state. They are important for agrarian economies and for nations looking to supplement their fuel supply without relying on fossil fuel imports.

| Property               | Value                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Base Construction Cost | 15,000 (+1,250 per additional level) |
| Max Per State          | 10                                   |
| Shares Building Slots  | Yes                                  |
| Corporate Tax Factor   | 2.6                                  |
| Energy Consumption     | 0.10 GW per level                    |
| Base Workers           | 0.188 million per level              |
| Fuel Output            | 8 per hour per level                 |
| Local Supply           | +0.015 per level                     |

Agriculture districts also interact with the Farmers internal faction, their construction speed and tax income can be boosted by maintaining high faction opinion.

### Energy Infrastructure

Energy Infrastructure is a **keystone building**: each state can have at most one, and it competes with Industrial Infrastructure for the same keystone slot. It boosts energy-related construction and provides additional building slots.

| Property               | Value                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Base Construction Cost | 33,000                                                                                                                   |
| Max Per State          | 1 (keystone slot)                                                                                                        |
| Effect                 | +5% building slots, +10% renewable energy generation, +10% nuclear reactor construction speed, +10% factory repair speed |

### Industrial Infrastructure

Industrial Infrastructure is the alternative keystone building. It increases the efficiency of resource extraction in the state.

| Property               | Value                                                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Base Construction Cost | 36,000                                                 |
| Max Per State          | 1 (keystone slot)                                      |
| Effect                 | +15% resource gain efficiency per infrastructure level |

Choose between Energy and Industrial Infrastructure based on the state's role: energy-producing states benefit from the Energy keystone, while resource-rich states benefit from the Industrial keystone.

## Advanced Industrial Buildings

Millennium Dawn introduces three advanced building types that produce strategic resources essential for modern military equipment and high-tech industry. These buildings share state building slots with other industrial buildings and scale in cost with each additional level.

### Microchip Plants

Microchip plants produce **Microchips**, a strategic resource required for advanced electronics, guided munitions, and modern military systems.

| Property               | Value                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Construction Cost | 45,000 (+2,500 per additional level)              |
| Resource Output        | 20 Microchips per level                           |
| Resource Input         | 2 Technology Metals + 1 Precious Metals per level |
| Max Per State          | 5                                                 |
| Shares Building Slots  | Yes                                               |
| Corporate Tax Factor   | 4.0                                               |
| Energy Consumption     | 0.75 GW per level                                 |
| Base Workers           | 0.0375 million per level                          |

Microchip plants have the second-highest corporate tax factor in the game (behind offices), making them a strong source of tax revenue. However, they require a steady supply of Technology Metals and Precious Metals to operate -- countries without domestic access to these resources will need to import them.

### Composite Plants

Composite plants produce **Advanced Composites**, a strategic resource used in advanced armor, aircraft construction, and modern naval vessels.

| Property               | Value                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Construction Cost | 45,000 (+2,500 per additional level)                    |
| Resource Output        | 16 Advanced Composites per level                        |
| Resource Input         | 1 Rubber + 1 Precious Metals + 1 Fossil Fuels per level |
| Max Per State          | 5                                                       |
| Shares Building Slots  | Yes                                                     |
| Corporate Tax Factor   | 3.5                                                     |
| Energy Consumption     | 0.80 GW per level                                       |
| Base Workers           | 0.0375 million per level                                |

Composite plants require three different input resources (Rubber, Precious Metals, and Fossil Fuels), making them the most resource-intensive building to sustain. Countries with limited resource access should secure trade agreements or invest in synthetic refineries to supply the Rubber component.

### Synthetic Refineries

Synthetic refineries produce both **rubber** (3 per level) and **fuel** (2 per hour per level), making them a dual-purpose strategic building.

| Property               | Value                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Base Construction Cost | 32,000                                     |
| Resource Output        | 3 Rubber per level + 2 fuel/hour per level |
| Max Per State          | 2                                          |
| Shares Building Slots  | Yes                                        |
| Corporate Tax Factor   | 3.0                                        |
| Energy Consumption     | 0.20 GW per level                          |
| Base Workers           | 0.184 million per level                    |

Synthetic refineries are the most labor-intensive advanced building by far, employing nearly 5 times as many workers per level as microchip or composite plants. They are critical for resource-poor nations that need Rubber for Advanced Composite production and fuel for mechanized and naval operations. Researching advanced refinery technologies increases Rubber output by +1 per level per tech tier.

### Input Resource Shortages

Microchip and composite plants require input resources to operate. If you run short of these inputs, production is reduced proportionally -- up to a maximum penalty of -95%.

**Microchip Plants** check Technology Metals and Precious Metals supply weekly:

- Technology Metals shortages are weighted 1.25x heavier than Precious Metals shortages
- If both inputs are completely exhausted, microchip output drops to 5% of normal

**Composite Plants** check Rubber, Precious Metals, and Fossil Fuels supply weekly:

- Rubber shortages are weighted 1.5x heavier than Precious Metals shortages
- All three inputs must be available for full production

**Energy shortages** also reduce microchip and composite production. If your country has an electricity deficit, plant output is further penalized in addition to any input resource shortages. Production line technology research reduces the energy demand of both plant types.

Securing a stable supply of input resources -- through domestic mining, trade agreements, or synthetic refineries (for Rubber) -- is essential before investing heavily in advanced plants.

### Civilian Microchip Consumption

Beyond military equipment, microchips are consumed by the civilian economy. This consumption is recalculated monthly and scales with two factors:

- **Population consumption**: Based on total population multiplied by GDP per capita. Wealthier, larger nations consume far more civilian microchips.
- **Office park consumption**: Each staffed office building consumes additional microchips proportional to its worker fulfillment.

The combined civilian demand is subtracted from available microchip supply. If demand exceeds supply:

- **At war**: Military equipment production takes priority. The civilian sector receives whatever is left, and shortfalls apply a stability penalty (up to -15%).
- **At peace**: The civilian sector takes priority. Military production may suffer instead.

This means rapidly industrializing nations that build many offices and grow their GDP per capita will face increasing microchip demand even without expanding their military. Countries should plan microchip plant construction to stay ahead of both military and civilian consumption.

### Military Equipment Requirements

Microchips and Advanced Composites are required to produce modern military equipment. The main categories include:

**Microchip-dependent equipment:**

| Equipment Type             | Microchips Required                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Electronic warfare systems | 1-3 per unit (scales with tech level) |
| SAM missile systems        | 1 per unit                            |
| Guided missiles            | 1 per unit                            |
| Ballistic missiles         | 2 per unit                            |
| Nuclear missiles           | 2 per unit                            |
| Advanced artillery         | 4-8 per unit                          |
| Anti-air systems           | 1-2 per unit                          |
| Anti-tank (ATGM) systems   | 1-2 per unit                          |
| Advanced tank chassis      | 1-2 per unit                          |
| Advanced aircraft          | 1-2 per unit                          |
| Ship combat modules        | 1-4 per module (scales with level)    |

**Advanced Composite-dependent equipment:**

| Equipment Type       | Advanced Composites Required         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Advanced artillery   | 2 per unit                           |
| Advanced aircraft    | 1-2 per unit                         |
| Modern naval vessels | 1-6 per ship (scales with ship type) |

Without sufficient Microchip or Advanced Composite stockpiles, production of these equipment types will stall or slow significantly. Nations planning a modern military buildup should establish Microchip and Advanced Composite production well before they need to ramp up equipment manufacturing.

### Building Employment Values

Every building in Millennium Dawn requires workers from your population. The base worker requirement per level (in millions) is multiplied by a GDP-dependent factor -- wealthier nations need more workers per building due to higher service-sector overhead. The worker requirement can be further modified by the **Employment Pressure** law and building-specific modifiers.

| Building                | Base Workers (millions per level) |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Offices                 | 0.473                             |
| Civilian Factories      | 0.206                             |
| Agriculture Districts   | 0.188                             |
| Synthetic Refineries    | 0.184                             |
| Nuclear Reactors        | 0.148                             |
| Microchip Plants        | 0.0375                            |
| Composite Plants        | 0.0375                            |

When planning your economy, consider the employment impact of your building choices. Offices and civilian factories employ the most people per level, which helps reduce unemployment but requires a large working-age population. Microchip and composite plants employ relatively few workers, making them efficient for smaller nations that need high-value output without straining their labor pool. Synthetic refineries sit in the middle, employing significantly more than other advanced buildings.

If buildings cannot be fully staffed, their output is reduced proportionally to the manpower fulfillment ratio.

## MD-Specific Buildings

Millennium Dawn adds several building types beyond the base game. These buildings generate tax revenue, produce resources, and serve key roles in the economy.

### Offices

Offices are a purely economic building that generates corporate tax income. They have a high tax factor of 5.0 per level, the highest of any building, making them the most efficient source of corporate tax revenue. Build offices early to boost your income.

- **Building Slots**: Shares building slots with other production buildings
- **Max Level**: 50 per state

### Network Infrastructure

Network infrastructure represents a country's internet and telecommunications capacity. Each level provides a **+5% state productivity growth modifier**, making it one of the best long-term investments for increasing building output.

- **Max Level**: 6 per state
- **Upkeep**: Costs a small weekly infrastructure expense per level

### Agriculture Districts

Agriculture districts represent a country's farming sector. They produce fuel (representing ethanol/biofuel) and local supplies. They also generate corporate tax revenue with a factor of 2.6 per level.

- **Max Level**: 10 per state
- **Produces**: Fuel and local supplies per level
- **Shares building slots** with other production buildings

### Microchip Plants

Microchip plants produce **microchips**, an advanced resource used in high-tech equipment. Each level produces 20 microchips but consumes tungsten and chromium. They have a tax factor of 4.0 per level.

- **Max Level**: 5 per state
- **Resource Cost**: Tungsten and chromium per level
- **Shares building slots** with other production buildings

### Composite Plants

Composite plants produce **composites**, an advanced material used in modern military and civilian equipment. Each level produces 16 composites but consumes rubber, chromium, and oil. They have a tax factor of 3.5 per level.

- **Max Level**: 5 per state
- **Resource Cost**: Rubber, chromium, and oil per level
- **Shares building slots** with other production buildings

### Energy Buildings

Three building types generate electricity (see the [Electricity](#electricity) section):

| Building                        | Fuel Source            | Output (base) | Max Level |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Fossil Fuel Powerplant          | Fuel                   | 2 GW          | 20        |
| Nuclear Reactor                 | Reactor-Grade Material | 5 GW          | 20        |
| Renewable Energy Infrastructure | None                   | 0.5 GW        | 20        |

### Infrastructure Keystones

Two mutually exclusive keystone buildings provide state-wide bonuses. Only one can be built per state.

- **Energy Infrastructure**: Boosts renewable energy generation, nuclear reactor construction speed, and factory repair speed. Also adds building slots.
- **Industrial Infrastructure**: Increases resource gain efficiency per infrastructure level in the state.

## Immigration

Immigration is one way to grow your population. Migration happens automatically, but you can adjust the acceptance level by changing the stage of **Migration Laws** (found at the far right of Policies in the Politics window).

Immigration control costs money. Stricter restrictions cost more to enforce. The immigration rate is calculated from factors including national productivity, unemployment rate, and war status, and is further modified by national spirits and other sources. The Economic Cycle also affects migration: higher growth stages attract more immigrants, while depression and recession drive emigration.

## International Investments

International investments let you fund construction projects in foreign states. Completed buildings permanently join the target state, and you earn passive income, approximately **6% annually** on your total invested value. You also gain influence over the target country with each accepted project. Up to 15 projects can run simultaneously.

For a full breakdown of buildable types, costs, duration mechanics, ROI calculation, and influence gain, see the [Investments Guide](/player-tutorials/investments-guide/).

### International Market

The International Market is a vanilla HOI4 mechanic that Millennium Dawn includes with modifications. It allows you to buy and sell **military equipment** (weapons, vehicles, aircraft, etc.) using civilian factories. In MD, it is limited to **1 civilian factory** allocated to the market. When you purchase equipment, the income is sent to the selling nation, which receives a proportional amount based on their corporate tax rate. Raw resources like oil, steel, and aluminium cannot be traded on the International Market, those are handled through the standard civilian factory trade system.

---

## Internal Investment

Internal investments apply temporary modifiers to your own states, things like productivity growth bonuses, construction speed buffs, extra building slots, and resource output boosts. Each option costs **75 Political Power** plus a treasury payment scaled to your GDP and lasts 120–180 days. The number of concurrent investments you can run scales with your power rank (2 slots for minor powers, up to 6 for superpowers).

For the full list of options, costs, effects, and tips, see the [Investments Guide](/player-tutorials/investments-guide/).

## Agrarian Economy

The Agrarian Economy is a special economic system for very poor nations, represented by the **Agrarian Based Economy** national idea. Countries with this idea have a GDP per capita below $20,000 and rely heavily on agricultural output for income.

Once a country reaches $20,000 GDP per capita, it is considered industrialized and loses the agrarian economy idea.

### Crop Allocation

Agrarian countries manage two crop types:

- **Basic Crops**: Subsistence-oriented; provides stable income
- **Cash Crops**: Export-oriented; higher value but more volatile

Field allocation between basic and cash crops can be adjusted via the Agricultural Economy window. Allocation can be shifted in 1%, 5%, or 10% increments by clicking or using Ctrl/Shift+Click. Each reallocation costs political power.

Changes are **banked** and applied together when you click "Make Changes", rather than taking effect immediately.

### Agricultural Workers

The number of workers available for agriculture is determined by **literacy rate**. A lower literacy rate means more workers are available for the fields, producing more agricultural output, but at the cost of reduced research speed. Higher literacy shifts workers toward other sectors.

### Drought Events

Agrarian countries are vulnerable to drought events, which reduce agricultural output:

| Drought Type       | Scope                | Neighbor Impact |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------- |
| Localised Drought  | Specific areas       | Unlikely        |
| Regional Drought   | Whole regions        | Likely          |
| Widespread Drought | Vast swathes of land | Almost certain  |

Drought protections can be built up through decisions and national focuses to reduce severity.

## IMF and Bailouts

When your economy is struggling, several bailout options are available:

### Cheap Loans from the IMF

- **Cost**: 50 political power
- **Requirements**: GDP per capita above $5,000, interest rate below 15%, expenses exceeding income, no severe corruption
- **Cooldown**: 365 days
- **Effect**: Provides a subsidized loan to stabilize your economy

### African Investment Fund Loans

Available to African nations that have completed the AU shared focus to create the monetary fund:

- **Requirements**: Interest rate below 15%
- **Effect**: Reduces interest rate multiplier by 3 while active
- **Benefit**: An alternative to the IMF with potentially better terms for African economies

### Bailout Requests

When the economy is in severe distress (interest above 15%), countries can request bailouts from:

1. **IMF** (cheap loans, first resort)
2. **Neighboring countries** (diplomatic requests)
3. **Second-most influential country** (less diplomatic damage)
4. **Most influential country** (last resort, most influence cost)

If interest exceeds 25% and the country is not at war, the AI will default on its debt, triggering severe consequences.

## Strategic Tips

### Early Game

1. **Balance initial taxes**: Start moderate to avoid killing productivity
2. **Build offices first**: They provide high tax income per worker
3. **Monitor employment**: Don't overbuild factories without workers to staff them
4. **Check your reserve currency**: Ensure you are using a currency appropriate to your faction alignment

### Mid Game

1. **Invest internationally**: Generate passive income from foreign buildings
2. **Upgrade the Economic Cycle**: Major buffs for stability and construction speed
3. **Manage debt aggressively**: High interest cripples long-term growth
4. **Adjust economic laws**: Tune employment pressure, mining policies, and healthcare privatization to match your situation
5. **Watch your currency strength**: A collapsing currency feeds inflation and increases debt burden

### Late Game

1. **Maintain high social spending**: Reduces unemployment impact
2. **Optimize tax rates**: Find the balance between revenue and productivity
3. **Use aid and trade**: Leverage diplomatic relationships for supplementary income
4. **Consider monetary policy**: Use Expand Money Supply during deficits or Austerity during inflation

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Excessive military spending**: The fastest way to bankrupt your economy
- **Ignoring unemployment**: Leads to compounding stability penalties
- **High debt accumulation**: Interest costs compound and eventually trigger crisis events
- **Over-taxation**: Kills productivity growth and long-term revenue
- **Ignoring currency strength**: A weak currency spirals into inflation, higher debt costs, and economic instability
- **Neglecting bailout options**: Request IMF or influencer bailouts before interest rates exceed 15%
- **Ignoring electricity**: An energy deficit silently drags down construction, factory output, research, and tax income
- **Fighting inflation with only one tool**: Inflation responds to policy rate, taxes, budget balance, and currency together, relying on a single lever is less effective
- **Raising the policy rate without considering debt**: The policy rate contributes to your interest rate, so hiking it while heavily indebted can worsen a debt spiral even as it controls inflation
