description: Historical data behind Millennium Dawn's starting country values.

Sources for players who want to check the numbers behind the mod's starting conditions.
These are starting values, not forecasts. Gameplay changes them after the game begins.

## Starting inflation

The January 2000 start uses **1999 annual-average consumer price inflation** where a reported
figure is available. This is the change in the year's average Consumer Price Index (CPI),
not December-to-December inflation.

- **World Bank:** [Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG).
  The [1999 data](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/all/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?date=1999&format=json&per_page=400)
  supplies 159 country and economy matches. Aruba has a reported figure but no matching mod tag.
- **Argentina:** [IMF Country Report 2000/160, Table 1](https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/002/2000/160/article-A001-en.xml#A01app01tab01).
  Annual-average CPI fell **1.2%** in 1999. This is the historical Buenos Aires headline series,
  not the **1.8%** end-of-period decline.
- **Taiwan:** [Central Bank, 2006 historical indicators](https://www.cbc.gov.tw/public/data/publications/year2006/06-en-key.pdf).
  The 1999 general CPI entry is **0.17%**. This uses the published historical series in that report.
- **Russia:** [OECD CPI index via FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RUSCPIALLMINMEI).
  December 1999 over December 1998 gives **36.6%** (index 18.395 over 13.470), matching the
  Rosstat year-end figure. The mod previously used **36.5%** instead of the **85.7%** annual
  average; its **21.5%** starting value is a gameplay adjustment to reduce the output penalty.

### How the values are used

- Rates are stored as fractions, rounded to five significant digits. For example, the US rate
  of about **2.188%** becomes `inflation_rate_var = 0.02188`.
- Negative rates remain negative. Countries without a sourced figure receive no historical seed;
  a starting zero is not evidence that their real-world inflation was zero.
- Each country's starting rate fills the four-quarter tracker at startup. Later quarterly
  calculations replace one entry at a time, smoothing the first updates.
- Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have reported rates above **200%**. Their
  historical seeds are retained, but the quarterly calculation clamps inflation to **200%**.
- Belarus previously used a **32.6%** end-of-period rate instead of the 1999 annual average.
  Its starting rate is now **20%**; Russia starts at **21.5%** after a **36.5%** seed.
- Iran starts at **17%** after a **20.071%** seed, and Turkey starts at **35%** after a
  **64.867%** seed. These four lower rates are gameplay adjustments to output penalties.
- The World Bank's Serbia series is not copied to Kosovo or Montenegro. Its combined West Bank
  and Gaza series is used for Palestine, not Israel or a separate Gaza tag.

## Starting policy rate

`cb_policy_rate` is the central bank policy rate in whole percentage points. The GUI steps it by
1 and clamps it to -10 to 30. The quarterly AI uses one-point or three-point steps toward its policy
rate target, can cut to -10, and keeps its 20% hike ceiling. The January 2000 start uses the official
policy rate in force on **2000.1.1** where that instrument is documented. Half-percentage values
round half up (5.50 becomes 6). Rates above 30 are stored as 30. Ukraine starts at that cap.
Russia, Turkey, and Romania stay at 20 from the previous gameplay ceiling.

Euro-area founding members already sat at 3, which matches the ECB main refinancing rate of
**3.00%**. Sweden (3.25%) and Denmark (about 3.3%, euro peg) also round to 3, so those files are
unchanged. Countries without a sourced 2000.1.1 policy rate keep the existing default of 3. That
is a fallback, not a claim that their central bank was at 3%. Formables, rebels, and breakaway
tags are not copied from a parent.

Historical seed data remains nonnegative. During play, rates can fall to -10%. During deflation,
the AI target uses the actual negative inflation rate rather than the positive low-inflation
baseline. Negative rates then provide additional inflation stimulus below the neutral rate.

Greece had not yet joined the euro. The 10.75% rate is the 14-day intervention rate still in
force on 2000.1.1. The Bank of Greece cut it to 9.75% on 26 January 2000. The Bank of England
raised Bank Rate to 5.75% on 13 January 2000. Both files use the New Year's Day setting.

Thailand adopted inflation targeting and an official 14-day RP policy rate in May 2000. The
seed uses the end-1999 14-day repurchase rate, which was already the money-market signal.
Hong Kong's Base Rate is mechanical under the currency board (US federal funds target plus
150 basis points). Chile is omitted: the 1999 TPM was a real rate, not a nominal policy rate.

The seed sits on the next line after `inflation_rate_var` when that country has a
historical inflation value. New tags and later history files should keep
`cb_policy_rate = 3` unless a 2000.1.1 source exists. Runtime startup still writes 3
when the variable is missing.

## Rail Terminal Placement

Before this pass no state in Millennium Dawn started with a `rail_terminal`, so every real-world freight and passenger
hub began the game at zero. 81 states now start with one. This page records the tier criteria, the sources the
selection was drawn from, and the specific hub behind each state, so a later balance or accuracy pass can argue with
the picks instead of guessing at them.

The values live in `history/states/<id>-<name>.txt` inside the `buildings` block. Modding rules for those files are in
[the state README](https://github.com/MillenniumDawn/Millennium-Dawn/blob/main/history/states/README.md).

### Data sources

The selection is a curated list, not a mechanical import of one dataset. There is no single global register of rail
terminal capacity that covers 2000 to today, so each pick is anchored to a documented claim about the facility named
in its entry:

- yard size and throughput: [Bailey Yard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Yard) (~2,850 acres, ~139 trains and
  14,000 cars a day), [Maschen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maschen_Marshalling_Yard) (280 ha, largest in Europe and
  second largest in the world), and the [list of rail yards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rail_yards) for the
  rest
- station passenger throughput: [Guinness World Records](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/busiest-station)
  for Shinjuku (2.7 million a day) and the
  [list of busiest railway stations in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_railway_stations_in_Europe)
  for Gare du Nord and the London terminals
- network share: [Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning](https://cmap.illinois.gov/regional-plan/goals/recommendation/maintain-the-regions-status-as-north-americas-freight-hub/)
  for Chicago handling about a quarter of US rail traffic with all six Class I railroads present
- intermodal and inland ports: [Port of Duisburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Duisburg) (world's largest
  inland container port, over 30% of China to Europe rail freight) and
  [City Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Deep,_Gauteng) (Africa's largest dry port)
